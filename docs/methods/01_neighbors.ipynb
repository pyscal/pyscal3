    "## Fixed cutoff method\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common method to calculate the nearest neighbors of an atom is\n",
    "using a cutoff radius. The neighborhood of an atom for calculation of\n",
    "Steinhardt\\'s parameters {cite}`Steinhardt1983` is often carried out using this method.\n",
    "Commonly, a cutoff is selected as the first minimum of the radial\n",
    "distribution functions. Once a cutoff is selected, the neighbors of an\n",
    "atom are those that fall within this selected radius. The following code\n",
    "snippet will use the cutoff method to calculate neighbors. In this example, `conf.dump` is assumed to\n",
    "be the input configuration of the system. A cutoff radius of 3 is\n",
    "assumed for calculation of neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import pyscal.core as pc\n",
    "sys = pc.System()\n",
    "sys.read_inputfile('conf.dump')\n",

    "## Adaptive cutoff methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A fixed cutoff radius can introduce limitations to explore the local\n",
    "environment of the particle in some cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   At finite temperatures, when thermal fluctuations take place, the\n",
    "    selection of a fixed cutoff may result in an inaccurate description\n",
    "    of the local environment.\n",

    "    the first shell of both structures can be difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve a more accurate description of the local\n",
    "environment, various adaptive approaches have been proposed. Two of the\n",
    "methods implemented in the module are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solid angle based nearest neighbor algorithm (SANN)\n",
    "\n",
    "SANN algorithm {cite}`VanMeel2012` determines the cutoff radius by counting the solid\n",
    "angles around an atom and equating it to $4\\pi$. The algorithm solves\n",
    "the following equation iteratively.\n",

    "> $$R_i^{(m)} = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^m r_{i,j}}{m-2} < r_{i, m+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ is the host atom, $j$ are its neighbors with $r_{ij}$ is the\n",

    "particle $i$ which is found by increasing the neighbor of neighbors $m$\n",
    "iteratively. For a description of the algorithm and more details, please\n",
    "check the reference {cite}`VanMeel2012`. SANN algorithm can be used to find the\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since SANN algorithm involves sorting, a sufficiently large cutoff is\n",
    "used in the beginning to reduce the number entries to be sorted. This\n",
    "parameter is calculated by,\n",

    "algorithm similar to adaptive common neighbor analysis {cite}`Stukowski2012`. This\n",
    "adaptive cutoff is calculated by first making a list of all neighbor\n",

    "using the respective keywords.\n",

## Acknowledgements

We acknowledge [Bond order
analysis](https://github.com/WolfgangLechner/StructureAnalysis) code for the
inspiration and the base for what later grew to be `pyscal`. We are also
thankful to the developers of [Voro++](math.lbl.gov/voro++/) and
[pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for developing
the great tools that we could use in `pyscal`.  We are grateful for the help and support received during the [E-CAM High Throughput Computing ESDW](https://www.e-cam2020.eu/event/4424/?instance_id=71) held in
[Turin](https://www.polito.it/?lang=en) in 2018 and 2019. This module was developed at the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced
Materials Simulation](http://www.icams.de/content), at the [Ruhr
University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en), Germany.

## Acknowledgements

- [Bond order analysis](https://github.com/WolfgangLechner/StructureAnalysis) code for the inspiration and the base for what later grew to be `pyscal`. 
- [Voro++](math.lbl.gov/voro++/) and [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for developing the great tools that we could use in `pyscal3`.  
- [E-CAM High Throughput Computing ESDW](https://www.e-cam2020.eu/event/4424/?instance_id=71) held in [Turin](https://www.polito.it/?lang=en) in 2018 and 2019 for programming help, especially David W.H. Swenson and Alan O'Cais.
